## About Dataset

While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many
counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found
out that the iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and
easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like
dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.
